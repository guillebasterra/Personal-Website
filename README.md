Essentially a link-tree, but with a fun morphing sphere

The sphere consists of a bunch of rods whose lengths are determined by a perlin noise shader. The perlin noise shader is in turn affected by the mouse position, which results in a consitantly shifting surface that also reacts to the cursor position.
